#Getting started

Use it
------

1. Copy index.min.js
1. Replace `{{ACCOUNT_TOKEN}}` with yours from the Chameleon dashboard.
1. Include it on all HTML pages (before the closing `</head>` tag)
1. Include it *only* in production (even if you have a staging and/or test instances).
1. For all private pages, call `chmln.setup(userProperties)`
1. Deploy the app

`chmln.setup` spec
------

The `chmln.setup` call specifies a user identity that you reference across the user's lifetime. Every `chmln.setup` call must have a user id (UID) and time that the user was created.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **uid** - _required_ | A unique identifier for the user in your database. |
| **created** - _required_ | The date the user's account was first created. Any date format will work.  |
| **email** - _recommended_ | The email address of the user |
| **plan** - _recommended_ | Which plan a user falls under (i.e `gold`, `startup`, `enterprise`) |
| **role** - _recommended_ | The specific type of tasks this user can perform (i.e. `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `billing`) |
| **spend** - _recommended_ | The amount of monthly revenue generated by the user's account |

* Recommended properties are optional but are valuable.

Examples
------

Setup with email, plan and role properties:
```javascript
chmln.setup({uid: user.id, created: user.createdAt, email: user.email, plan: 'gold', role: 'admin'});
```
